# LA Crime data Analysis
 
***Crime Data Analysis Project***

This repository contains the analysis and visualizations performed on a crime dataset to extract insights about crime patterns. The primary goals of this project were to identify:

1. The hour with the highest frequency of crimes.
2. The area with the largest frequency of night crimes.
3. The number of crimes committed against victims of different age groups.


***Data Source***

The dataset used for this analysis is crimes.csv, which includes various features such as the date and time of the crime, the description of the crime, and details about the location and victims.

***Tools and Libraries***

The following tools and libraries were utilized in this project:

1. Python: The programming language used for the entire analysis.
2. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
3. NumPy: For numerical operations.
4. Matplotlib: For creating customized visualizations.
5. Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.

***Analysis Steps***

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
The dataset was loaded using Pandas, with date fields parsed appropriately and the time field converted to hours for easier analysis.

2. Identifying Peak Crime Hour
The time of occurrence was grouped by hour to determine the hour with the highest number of crimes.

3. Analyzing Night Crimes
Night crimes were defined, and the area with the highest frequency of night crimes was identified.

4. Victim Age Analysis
The number of crimes committed against victims of different age groups was analyzed.

***Results***

1. Peak Crime Hour: The hour with the highest frequency of crimes was identified, and a histogram was created to visualize the crime frequency by hour.
2. Night Crimes Area: The area with the highest frequency of night crimes was identified.
3. Victim Age Analysis: A histogram was created to show the distribution of crimes against victims of different age groups.
4. Finally, a heatmap was created to show the distribution of number of crimes committed in different areas throughout the day.
